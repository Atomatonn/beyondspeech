                                    Speech-Language Pathology. She is passionate about providing individualized,
                                    relationship-based therapy that includes each client’s family in the process. She
                                    has had a special interest in working with non-speaking, minimally speaking, and
                                    unreliably speaking individuals on the Autism Spectrum since undergrad and is a
                                    registered Spelling to Communicate (S2C) practitioner. Sam also has years of
                                    experience with Early Intervention and treating speech sound disorders (including
                                    Childhood Apraxia of Speech). She firmly believes that therapy is not “one size fits
                                    all!" She founded Beyond Speech because she saw a need for a practice that truly
                                    presumes competence in all clients regardless of their diagnosis!

                                    find their voice. Hailing from Youngstown, Ohio, she is a former college softball
                                    player at the University of Northwestern Ohio, where she earned a degree in
                                    Marketing. Throughout her academic and athletic career, Kayley developed a strong
                                    sense of discipline and leadership, which she now channels into her work supporting
                                    individuals who communicate through S2C.

                                    Her involvement in this communication method grew when her non-speaking brother
                                    began to use S2C. Inspired by the profound impact it had on their relationship,
                                    Kayley became committed to raising awareness and helping others find the gift of
                                    communication. Through her personal and professional experiences, she is dedicated
                                    to promoting inclusion, understanding, and empowerment for those who use spelling to
                                    communicate.

                                    Taryn graduated with a Master of Science in Recreation Therapy from Northwest
                                    Missouri State University. She will soon be a Registered S2C Practitioner and is
                                    grateful to play a role in liberating the voices of nonspeakers. Taryn takes a
                                    person-centered, strengths-based approach and believes autonomy in life and leisure
                                    is key to holistic well-being. She strives to empower spellers and enhance their
                                    quality of life by providing purposeful, enriching activities, supporting
                                    communication, and developing their independence. Her ultimate goal is that her
                                    clients will realize their full potential and cultivate a life of fulfillment.
