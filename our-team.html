                      received a Master of Arts in Speech-Language Pathology.
                      She is passionate about providing individualized,
                      relationship-based therapy that includes each client’s
                      family in the process. She has had a special interest in
                      working with non-speaking, minimally speaking, and
                      unreliably speaking individuals on the Autism Spectrum
                      since undergrad and is a registered Spelling to

                      experience with Early Intervention and treating speech
                      sound disorders (including Childhood Apraxia of Speech).
                      She firmly believes that therapy is not “one size fits
                      all!" She founded Beyond Speech because she saw a need for
                      a practice that truly presumes competence in all clients
                      regardless of their diagnosis!

                      about providing services to children of all ages in the

                    <p style="display: none" class="fullText">
                      Kayley is a passionate advocate for helping non-speaking
                      individuals of all ages find their voice. Hailing from
                      Youngstown, Ohio, she is a former college softball player
                      at the University of Northwestern Ohio, where she earned a
                      degree in Marketing. Throughout her academic and athletic
                      career, Kayley developed a strong sense of discipline and
                      leadership, which she now channels into her work
                      supporting individuals who communicate through S2C. Her
                      involvement in this communication method grew when her
                      non-speaking brother began to use S2C. Inspired by the
                      profound impact it had on their relationship, Kayley
                      became committed to raising awareness and helping others
                      find the gift of communication. Through her personal and
                      professional experiences, she is dedicated to promoting
                      inclusion, understanding, and empowerment for those who
                      use spelling to communicate.
